    "\n",
    "Pursuing a triple major in Data Science, Economics, and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is an ambitious goal that offers a powerful combination of skills. These fields complement each other well with data analysis, economic modeling, and programming all playing a big role in the modern world. However, figuring out how to fit the core requirements for three majors into one manageable schedule is no easy task. Furthermore, our project aims to tackle this challenge by creating an optimization model that helps students map out the most efficient class schedule, utilizing overlapping courses between the three majors, to save time and reduce stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these majors open up opportunities in areas like machine learning, financial modeling, and software development. However, the workload can seem overwhelming, and the logistics of balancing core classes, electives, prerequisites, and credit limits can feel like a puzzle. That’s where this project comes in—to take some of the guesswork out of the process and help students see a clear path forward. Our model uses linear programming, to find the best way to meet the requirements for all three majors while minimizing the time it takes to graduate. The model will take into account things like which courses have prerequisites, and how many credits a student can realistically take in a semester. We will also focus on finding overlapping courses that can count toward multiple majors. For example, many Data Science electives also count as Computer Science electives, this way, a student does not have to repeat courses and can comfertabley satisfy requiremnts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project we provide four different models:\n",
    "1) A base optimization model which will print out an optimal schedule to satisfy the core requiremtns for the three majors\n",
    "2) Three case studies of customized optimization models to provide different situations a student might be in when trying to tripple major (take specific courses, optimality trade off - focusing more on a specific major, taking specific courses later, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a practical tool that students and advisors can use to make smarter decisions about course planning. Instead of spending hours piecing together schedules, students can use this model to get a personalized plan that balances efficiency and flexibility. Plus, the approach could work for other combinations of majors in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this model was hand-collected from the individual major pages offered through UW-Madison's pulic website. Course name, credits, and difficulty were put into a CSV file and loaded into our Jupyter Notebook. We organized the data, cleaned it, and parsed it for further analysis."

    "\n",
    "Base Model: \n",
    "Bellow, we have formed a mathematical optimization model to achieve our desired output. This is a Mixed Interger Programing model since we define binary vairables for the courses we take for all x_i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is important to note that each major has its own core and elective requirements out of many different course options. Hence, each constraint in our model will represent a course that has to be taken for that specific requirement. Moreover, we can have elective courses that can be taken from the elective requirement or from core requirements - this complication has been modeled bellow.\n",

    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\underset{x, e}{\\text{minimize}}\\qquad & c^\\top x \\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to:} \\qquad & A x + e \\geq b \\\\\n",
    "& x \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\quad e \\geq 0, \\quad b \\geq 0\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Decision Variable: \n",
    "    - Let x ∈ {0,1}, which is a Binary Variable whetjher each course is taken or not; here x_i indicate whether a course is taken (x_i = 1) or not (x_i = 0). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Objective Function: \n",
    "    - Let c' be a vector of ones and let x_i be the decision variable we aim to minimize. It is clear that here, we minimize the total number of courses taken while satisfying core, elective, and credit requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Constraints: \n",
    "    - Let A be a matrix where each row represents a constraint equation's coefficients for courses. Consequently, we have the vector b representing the total number of required courses for each constraints. Hence, this will help us formulate each constraint, where out of all the different options of courses from matrix A, we must take exactly b number of courses to satisfy the major requiremnt. Notice the greater than equal to sign, ensuring that we are always taking atleast a total of b number of courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Finally, we define e >= 0, which is an auxilary slack variable for elective constraints. Some majors have electives, where you can take a course from the elective requiremnt or from a core requirement. In such cases, we utilize an external variable e to either remove or add the total number of courses required from the requiremnt constraint (to understand this more, view the comments in the base model). The introduction of this variable will disallow the model to \"double dip\" elective courses, furthermore, producing incorrect outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For instance, let us say for some constraint j, we need 2 courses from a range of Computer Science courses. Here, our A matrix will represent the different number of courses we can choose from. The vector b would be = 2, as we need 2 courses to satisfy the requirement. And let us say that we choose to take a course to satisfy for some constraint k, then we can set e = -1, allowing us to then take 2 + 1 = 3 courses for that requirement instead of 2. \n",

    "\n",
    "Below is the base case of our model. The objective is to minimize the difficulty of courses taken while meeting all requriements. This difficulty is based off of the first number of the course name (524 would be considered more difficult than a 400 level course). In order to keep track of courses, we introduced a binary variable, course_taken, that has a value of 1 if a course should be taken, and 0 if it should not be. The constraints are based off university requirements for all 3 majors. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of our constraints are based off the different requriements across all 3 majors. There are some courses, such as Calculus, that are required by all 3 majors. But all other constraints can be seen categorized by the major they are fulfulling. The binary variable is seen in conjuction with each individual course that can fulfill that requirement and set to the number of courses required in that specific category. One important note on our model is that we only considered 'core' classes. There are several liberal arts requirements, however, due to the fact that there are 100's if not 1000's of electives to choose from that will not impact the major courses themselves, we felt it was better to leave these our to not create further noise and distraction in our ourcomes. But, these have been accounted for, in our constraints and schedule output we account for these classes with credit limits and the number of core classes taken per semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early stages of our modeling we were having difficulty getting our constraints to work correctly, mainly the elective requirements for all majors. Each major requires students to take certain categories of classes AND a certain number of additional electives, which can be additional classes from these categories. For example, Computer Science students are required to take 1 course in the applications category. In addition to this they must take 2 electives, if a student particularly liked applications, they can choose their elective courses to be applications. Due to this, our optimal solution was allowing elective courses to simultaneously count for required categories. This was lowering the number of courses a student must take, and taking away from the integrity and legitimacy of our model. In order to combat this issue, we introduced 7 variables to represent the different electives. These variables were initialized to 0. Throughout our model, if a course in a particular area is taken the respective variables value increases by one. At the end, the counts of these variables are subtracted from each major constraint to ensure that no courses are being counted for different requriements and allowing for a more accurate model."

    "### 4.1 Case I — Weighted Objective for CS Courses\n",
    "[↑ Back to top](#toc-top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation A: Optimality Trade Off - Looking at the schedule of a student who wants to take the minimum number of courses to triple major, but wants to emphasize on taking more Computer Science courses and difficult courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next iteration of our model, we adjusted the objective function to place a greater emphasis on CS courses. This update was a valuable step as it increased the complexity of the model while reflecting a realistic scenario: a student who wants to pursue a triple major but has a strong preference for one subject and wants to take diffcult courses. To implement this change, we:\n",
    "- introduced a penalty for all non-CS courses in the objective function,\n",
    "- take into consideration the difficulty of the course, from the difficulty dictionary we defined earlier in our objective function,\n",
    "- add a constraint to ensure that we take a full course load of courses per semester, maximizing the difficulty as much as possible! (taking around 108 credits worth of core courses)\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding this penalized weight, our model ensures that the student meets the minimum required courses for Economics and Data Science while allowing them to dedicate as much of their academic schedule as possible to Computer Science courses. This change better reflects the real-world decision-making process of students who prioritize one major over others, ensuring that the model remains realistic and aligned with student preferences while still meeting graduation requirements. This has been effectivley done by implimenting a lambda parameter in the objective function (optimality trade off), allowing us to emphasize on Computer Science courses. To add on, we have taken the difficulty of the course into consideration in our objective function, to maximize taking the hardest courses possible at UW-Madison (all upper level courses from the number 400-600!)"

    "This iteration of our model represents a high-acheiving student who came in with both calculus requirements (Math 221 & Math 222) as well as CS200. Additionally, the student is particularly fond of optimization and specifically wants to take CS 524, CS 525, and CS 425. We included this iteration because we assume a student choosing to triple major is an overacheiver so them coming in with ample credits is also very likely. By changing our model to account for the students exisitng work, we increase the realisticness and robustness of our model allowing it to be a useable tool for a wider ranges of cases and students.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for these changes constraints were removed (like the CS and Calculus constraints), but the model largely stayed the same. To add another element of different to this case, we added the requriement of optimization classes being taken. Again, we felt this added a dimension of realness to our project and allows students to see that even when taking on a task as difficult as a triple major it's still possible and important to prioritize the classes you're the most interested in.

    "The final iteration of our course project simulates a student’s decision to triple major. The student starts with a double major in Data Science and Computer Science and later adds Economics as a third major. Due to the late addition, no Economics courses are taken before the switch. This reflects a common scenario where students, unsure of their academic options during their first year, may decide to pursue an additional major later in their studies.\n",

    "All of our models were sucessfully optimized with slightly different overall solutions/schedules. Henceforth, our model shows that a triple major at UW is possible if the right courses are taken.  Initially, the model focuses on meeting a broad set of multi-domain requirements with the smallest possible number of courses, demonstrating a baseline efficiency valuable for any student trying to graduate promptly. As we progress, the scenarios introduce increasingly nuanced priorities: one emphasizes the strategic selection of high-difficulty CS courses to align with a student’s specialized interests; another incorporates specific, advanced methodological courses, reflecting personal academic goals beyond standard requirements. The model also proves capable of adjusting to more realistic contexts, such as entering university with pre-earned credits or deciding to add a new major after the initial semesters. In each case, the solver adapts, finding feasible pathways that meet all domain constraints—sometimes even under altered objectives, like minimizing the difficulty of chosen Economics courses or ensuring certain majors are added late without delaying graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe a tool like this should be widely available and used for all students, advisors, and faculty to allow for ease of scheduling. Our model is an exciting example of how technology and computers can make tasks significantly more efficient than if a human performend it. For fun, we tried to manually map out a CS and Econ double major, a tasks that hundreds of UW Students do every single year. It took nearly an hour and 80+ clicks back and forth between major pages. Our model, took this problem with an additional major and did it in a matter of seconds, showing the models use and effectiveness. "

This most defintley complicates the model, considering there are so many combinations and possibilities of the same. Moreover, our model is only limited to three majors, however, we can easily scale this to as many majors we want by adding the correct data and constraints. This would involve adding a lot more constraints to the model as each requirement for the major would be a constraint. Finally, our schedule assumes that a student can take 4 core ourses a semester. While it is possible to do so and students do in fact do this, this can be quite rigorous and can not be done by everyone, hence, making it hard to triple major, yet feasible to do so.\n",

    "Future Work:\n",

    "Furthermore, this is defintley a very good base for future work as optimizing schedules at UW-Madison can be an amazing tool for students to use. If we can have a methodlogy to input any major at UW-Madison and create a course schedule for the same, then it can be applicable to all UW-Madison students who want to pick up more than one major. This is a great project that can be built in the future, a tool for all students to use along with their DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) reports that they regularly do. One can also attempt to major in between departments (for example, let us say engineering school and the letters and science school). This would complicate the model a lot more, but certainly can be implimented.\n",

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we successfully developed an optimization model that identifies the most efficient class schedule for students pursuing a triple major in Data Science, Economics, and Computer Science. By evaluating a range of objective functions, we were able to determine the optimal schedule that minimizes time to graduation while meeting all course requirements and student preferences. These objective functions considered factors such as course prerequisites, credit limits, and the overlap of courses across the three majors, ensuring that students can meet their academic goals without unnecessary delays or excess courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach not only provides a clear roadmap for students seeking a triple major, but also offers flexibility for future adjustments. In particular, the model can be extended to support other combinations of majors and minors. One potential direction is to build an input function that allows students to specify which majors they are interested in, enabling the model to generate personalized schedules for any combination of fields. This could be especially helpful for students who want to explore interdisciplinary studies beyond the three majors we considered. A tool at this scale would be all the more valuable to advisors and prospective students to see the true potential for opportunity here at UW-Madison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project not only highlights the potential of optimization techniques to solve complex scheduling problems, but also sets the stage for expanding the model to serve a broader range of students and academic pursuits. With further development, this tool could become an essential resource for students navigating the demands of interdisciplinary education.\n",
